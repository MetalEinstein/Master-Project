Problem Statement:
“Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?”

Rules: 
1. Each city needs to be visited exactly one time
2. We must return to the starting city, so our total distance needs to be calculated accordingly

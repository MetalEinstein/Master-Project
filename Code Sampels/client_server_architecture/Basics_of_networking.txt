Python Networking Tutorial
----------------------------------------------------

Introduction to IP adresses:

* An ip adress is an unique address that identifies a specific 
pc using the internet protocol to commuicate over the internet 

* A IP adress can be public and private
	- Public -> Given by the internet service provider
	- Private -> Provided by the router 

* In IP can be static and Dynamic 
	- Static -> Used by servers and websites 
	- Dynamic -> Used by computers and mobiles 


Introduction to Ports:

* While the IP adress can be said to define the city and street, 
the port defines the specific house on that street. We need both to connect to a 
specific computer.   

* Different ports can be used for different things like file transfer,
sending mail or showing web pages and so on.


Introduction to Sockets:

* Definition: A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link 
between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port
number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that the data is
destined to be sent to. An endpoint is a combination of an IP adress and a 
port number.


Direct + Reverse Connection:

* Direct Connection:
	- Requires a Host IP Adress + Port 
	- Requires a Socket 
	- Problems are:
		# It's difficult to get IP address
		# Even if we get the IP adress the IP adress is dynamic so
		  it's always changing 

* Reverse Connection:
	- Requires the Host IP adress + Port 
	- Requires a Socket 
	- The client instead connects to the server through a script containing
	  the servers IP address. Every time the clients IP changes the script
	  recalibrates.
	- Problem is:
		# The server IP adress will change. So to counteract this the client
		  can insted, through a script connect to a server which have a
		  static IP adress.

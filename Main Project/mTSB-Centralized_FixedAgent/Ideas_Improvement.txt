Possible Improvements
-------------------------------------------------

* Focused mutation:
	- First figure out which part of the genome affects the fitness
	  score the most negatively 
	
	- Next focus the mutations on thay part of the genome 

* Initial Large Population:
	- If the initial population is randomly created there exists a
	  great diversity of solutions, thus there is a high probability
	  that a solution close to the globally optimal one is in there 

	- So for the first loop there should be a big initial population.
	  after fitness scores are assigned pick the "N" best solutions 
	  for the next population. "N" will be the size of the new
	  population. 

* Identify periods of stagnation:
	- If a better solution isn't found for some time the population size
	  could expand in response for a single loop to search for one.

	- To create new individuals the "N" elites could be chosen at random
	  to be subject to a set of mutations. An elite subjected to a mutation
	  or set of mutations will be considered a new individual and added to
	  the population. The idea here is that the elites are closer to the 
	  global minimum thus just needs a kick in the right direction.
